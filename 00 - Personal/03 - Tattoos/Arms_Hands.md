I like the middle design the most, especially the flowers on the shoulder, which tie in nicely to the throat piece that I have provided a reference for.

This reference is more for the hand piece. Not sure how I feel about the designs on the fingers, or if I even want designs on the fingers in the first place.

I quite like how the flowers protrude onto the hand, and the design on the arm ties in nicely with the arm design from the first-middle reference on this page.
