I had a dream that there was a tall and skinny man that was in our yard looking at some of the things we had in it. I guess he thought it was a yard sale. I started to show him around when some people dropped from the sky and told him to go away. He refused. Then they started throwing punches. I woke up after about 5 minutes into the battle. I got dressed and went shopping with my Mom. While we were in Costco, I saw all of the people in my dream!
