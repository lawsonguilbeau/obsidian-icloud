Good morning, I woke up at 8:00 AM after going to bed at 1:30 AM. Today I have basically no school, but I will do Spanish. Mom wants me to complete the SAT tasks before the test, of which I will comply. I also need to write letters to my guitar teachers.

Today was busy, and I was not able to write letters to my guitar teachers, but I did take the SAT, and I got a 1,100 score. Joe, Nadine, Whitney, Gary, Mr. Wes, Mrs. Laurie, and Evie all came over for dinner this evening. Mom made chicken and dumplings. My lungs have continued to hurt for a while now, and I do hope that they will stop soon. If they don't, I hope that it won't be a problem in school tomorrow. Goodnight.
