<span style="background-color: maroon; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px;">10:41 PM</span>
Today I woke up at 6:30 to go to school. My lungs bothered me in Spanish, but other than that I have been fine. I got home around 2:00 PM, and proceeded to make yogurt and bread. Mom, Dad, and all of my other siblings were gone at this time, so I played Calamity with Jackson. Emma said that she would give me a hug for my birthday.
