## Journal

<span style="background-color: crimson; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px;">11:11 AM</span>
Today I woke up at 8:00 AM, ate cinnamon muffins for breakfast, and started school with mom, by praying, and doing yoga with the rest of my siblings like she requested. I will now start school by doing Spanish and Understanding the Culture, and them moving onto Math. Finally, I will organize my English III binder, and call it a day. 

<span style="background-color: crimson; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px;">4:41 PM</span>
Now I will actually start school.

School is done, mom helped my with science. I will now read Huckleberry Finn again before I go to bed.
