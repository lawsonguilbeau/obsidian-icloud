## Journal

Today I woke up at 11:00 AM, and washed dishes for my sister. When mom got home from cleaning the church, I ate lunch, changed the sheets on my younger siblings beds, and made dog food. After the dog food was made, I mowed the lawn for dad, and then took a cold shower. I will now finish the SAT practice test, and then eat dinner after. A side note, dad is canceling the Apple Music subscription, so I will be swapping to Spotify.

I took an ADHD and Autism test that mom wanted me to take, and I got an 87% on ADHD and a 100% on the Autism. The scores were higher than expected, and I am not sure how I feel about this.
