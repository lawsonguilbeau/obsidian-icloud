## Journal

<span style="background-color: red; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px;">11:38 PM</span>
Today we killed the meat chickens, and Mr. Wes' neighbors came over to help. After this, I cleaned the house, and played Calamity Terraria with Jackson. When I was finished playing with Jackson, I helped dad make dinner. We made fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and steamed vegetables. When dinner was finished, dad, the boys and I played Super Smash Bros. I also watched Dr. Who with mom, dad, and Evangeline. Goodnight, and a side note, I have been loving expressing my thoughts in a journal like this.
