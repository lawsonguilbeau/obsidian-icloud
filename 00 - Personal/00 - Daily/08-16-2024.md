## Journal

<span style="background-color: green; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px;">1:01 PM</span>
This morning was fabulous fun Friday, and I got a new pair of sunglasses. Mom made cinnamon rolls this morning, and I made macaroni with a b√©chamel sauce for lunch.

I know that it is the next day now, but I still want to write. I just got off from playing Calamity Terraria with Jackson. Prior to this, we left the house at 3:15 PM to bring Evangeline to gymnastics. Mom made ham salad sandwiches with sourdough bread in the car while we were waiting on Evangeline to finish with gymnastics (which ends at 6:00 on a Friday). We got to church at 6:45, and it ended at 8:15. Mom and I talked to Pastor Johnson about a counseling session regarding my OCD. We got home at 10:00 PM, and mom, Evangeline and I waited on dad to get back, (of which he did at 11:00 PM). That is when I went to go play with Jackson. I almost forgot, while at church, there was a new family that was invited by Daniel and Alesha that we met. I will write the letters to my guitar teachers tomorrow after we kill all of our meat chickens (of which Mr. Wes will assist in).
