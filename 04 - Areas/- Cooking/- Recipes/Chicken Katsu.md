## Ingredients
### For Chicken Katsu

- **2** boneless, skinless chicken breasts 

- Kosher salt  
  
- Freshly ground black pepper 
   
- **2/3** **c.**  all-purpose flour 

- **2**  large eggs

- **1** **1/4** **c.** panko breadcrumbs

- Vegetable oil, for frying 
  
### For katsu sauce

- **1/2** **c.** ketchup

- **1** **1/2** **Tbsp.** soy sauce 

- **1** **Tbsp.** Worcestershire sauce 

- **2** **tsp.** rice wine vinegar

- **1** **tsp.** Dijon mustard

## Directions

- **1.** Cut each breast in half, so that there are 4 cutlets. Place one cutlet between two pieces of plastic wrap on a cutting board and gently flatten to a ¼" thickness with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Repeat with remaining cutlets.

- **2.** Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and place in refrigerator. Optional: let chicken chill for 1 hour, uncovered, in refrigerator.

- **3.** Step 3Make katsu sauce: in a medium bowl, whisk to combine sauce ingredients.

- **4.** Place flour, eggs, and Panko in three shallow bowls, and whisk eggs thoroughly with 1 tablespoon water. Dredge one cutlet first in flour, then egg, then in Panko. Press Panko onto any spots that are not coated and transfer to a clean plate. Repeat until all cutlets are breaded.

- **5.** Heat 1/4" vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When oil is hot, but not smoking (350° on an instant-read thermometer) lower 2 cutlets gently into the hot oil, laying them down away from you to avoid splashing. Occasionally gently shake and swirl the pan so hot oil rolls over the top of the cutlets as they fry. Cook until underside is golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then flip and cook 1 1/2 to 2 minutes more. Transfer fried cutlets to a paper-towel lined plate and season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining cutlets, adding more oil to skillet if necessary.

- **6.** Cut fried cutlets into strips crosswise and serve with katsu sauce.
